# snake-game
This is the classic snake game that I created in Python using pygame. 

I experimented with using some Tkinter, lambda functions, and other pygame functionalities that I hadn't tried out before.

I plan on adding some more to the program to make it more fun.

# Can you beat my HIGH SCORE: 55

# TO DO:

Add sounds, give player the option to change the size of the board, and look into adding fun powerups that give the snake various abilities (extra lives, invincibility, etc.)
